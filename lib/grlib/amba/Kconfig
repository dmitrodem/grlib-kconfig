config  AHB_DEFMST
	int "Default AHB master"
	default 0
	help
		Sets the default AHB master (see AMBA 2.0 specification for definition).
		Should not be set to a value larger than the number of AHB masters - 1.
		For highest processor performance, leave it at 0.
config AHB_RROBIN
       bool "Round-robin arbiter"
       default n
       help
		Say Y here to enable round-robin arbitration of the AHB bus. A N will
  		select fixed priority, with the master with the highest bus index having
  		the highest priority
config AHB_SPLIT
       bool "AHB split-transaction support"
       default y
       help
		Say Y here to enable AHB split-transaction support in the AHB arbiter.
		Unless you actually have an AHB slave that can generate AHB split
		responses, say N and save some gates.
config AHB_FPNPEN
       bool "Enable full plug&play decoding"
       default y
       help
              Say Y here to enable full decoding of the PnP configuration records in
       	      in the AHB arbiter. When disabled the user-defined registers in the
	      PnP configuration records are not mapped in the configuration area
config AHB_IOADDR
       hex "AHB/APB bridge address (haddr[31:20])"
       default FFF
       help
              Selects the MSB adddress (HADDR[31:20]) of the AHB IO area, as defined 
       	      in the plug&play extentions of the AMBA bus. Should be kept to FFF 
       	      unless you really know what you are doing.
config APB_HADDR
       hex "AHB/APB bridge address (haddr[31:20])"
       default 800
       help
              Selects the MSB adddress (HADDR[31:20]) of the APB bridge. Should be
       	      kept at 800 for software compatibility.
config AHB_MON
      bool "Enable AMBA AHB monitor"
      default y
      help
            Say Y to enable the AHB bus monitor. The monitor will check for
            illegal AHB transactions during simulation. It has no impact on
            synthesis.

config AHB_MONERR
      bool "Report AHB errors"
      default y
      depends on AHB_MON
      help
		Print out detected AHB violations on console.
config AHB_MONWAR
      bool "Report AHB warings"
      default y
      depends on AHB_MON
      help 
      	    Print out detected AHB warnings on console.

config AHB_DTRACE
       bool "Write trace to simulation console"
       default n
       help
		Say yes here to write a trace of all AHB transfers to the
		simulator console. Has not impact on final netlist.
